      <h1>What Is Doctor Who?</h1>
      <p><img src="../images/extraimages/doctorwho2.jpg" alt="doctorwho" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage" />The cultish British television series  <em>Doctor Who</em> — which celebrates its 50th anniversary with a special to be simulcast around the world on Nov. 23 — is, to its fans, a cultural institution of the highest order. To the non-Whovian public, however, the escalating volume of <em>Who</em> chatter as the anniversary approaches may seem like nothing but white noise.</p>
      <p>We understand: It&rsquo;s the kind of pop-culture touchstone you&rsquo;re supposed to know about, but that&rsquo;s too complicated to even process if you don&rsquo;t already get it. Like, if you weren&rsquo;t born knowing about <em>Doctor Who </em>(which, to be fair, can seem to be the case for some Brits) then there&rsquo;s no point in trying to understand it.      </p>
      <p>While it&rsquo;s not physically possible for the <em>Who–</em>less to completely catch up in time for the anniversary, it is possible to understand the basics:</p>
      <h3><strong>It&rsquo;s not about a medical doctor</strong></h3>
      <p>The Doctor can&rsquo;t give you an Rx, but he is an alien Time Lord who travels through space and time to fight evil. Nor is his name &ldquo;Doctor Who.&rdquo; (His actual name is a secret.) When he dies, he can regenerate into a new form; 11 different actors have played the Doctor so far. He travels with a series of human companions but is not himself human, though he may look like one.</p>
      <h3><strong>The show hasn&rsquo;t actually run for 50 consecutive years </strong></h3>
      <p>The first version of the show ran from 1963 till 1989, and the reboot has been around since 2005, with a TV movie in the middle. But, unlike many other shows or movies that have gotten reboots, every episode and appearance is part of the same canon.</p>
      <p>(<strong>MORE</strong>: Why <em>Doctor Who</em> is Pop Culture Sci-Fi At Its Best)</p>
      <h3><strong>There is, of course, a specialized vocabulary</strong></h3>
      <p>In order to understand the words coming out of fans&rsquo; mouths, you&rsquo;ll need to know at least a few pieces of the show&rsquo;s lingo. For example, that blue police call-box is actually the <em>TARDIS</em>, which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space; it&rsquo;s a ship that travels through time and space (and while it&rsquo;s meant to blend in with its surroundings, it&rsquo;s been malfunctioning for 50 years now so it&rsquo;s stuck as the phone booth). The Doctor&rsquo;s other gadget is the <em>sonic screwdriver</em>. A <em>Dalek</em> is an alien creature that, having survived a nuclear apocalypse, must live inside a robot; they are bad.<em><br />
      </em></p>
      <h3><strong>The show is important</strong></h3>
      <p>It&rsquo;s not just that the show is long-lived and has a huge audience. <em>Doctor Who</em> is one of those shows that makes people think deep thoughts. To get started on understanding that layer of meaning, you can read in-depth articles like these: <em>The New Yorker </em>on how the show has managed to stay relevant while remaining a product of a specific time and place, by evolving the Doctor from a symbol of Britain&rsquo;s desire to play a guardian-like role in world politics to a more observation-centered symbol of modern anxieties; or <em>The Huffington Post</em> on Doctor Who and the intersection of fandom and commercialization. There are lots of books about the series, and there&rsquo;s even a documentary project about <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom, which was successfully crowd-funded this fall.</p>
      <h3><strong>The 50th-anniversary episode promises big plot revelations</strong></h3>
      <p>Executive producer Steven Moffat has said that the anniversary special, <em>The Day of the Doctor</em>, will &ldquo;change the course of the series.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s already been announced that in this year&rsquo;s Christmas special (coming in December) actor Peter Capaldi will take on the role of the Twelfth Doctor, so the current Doctor (played by Matt Smith) is in his last-hurrah stage. Fans already know that the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors and some past favorite characters will appear in this weekend&rsquo;s special, and major plot mysteries about the Doctor&rsquo;s history will be explained — particularly the Time War, a Dalek-Time Lord conflict that wasn&rsquo;t depicted on the show but has been mentioned many times. There are plenty of ways to catch up on what&rsquo;s known about the Time War (here, for example) but it may be the one <em>Doctor Who</em> element about which new viewers will know almost as much as veterans — at least for now.</p>
