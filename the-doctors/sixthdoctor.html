      <h1>The 6th Doctor</h1>
      <p>The Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)">the Doctor</a>, the protagonist of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television">science fiction television</a> series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>. He is portrayed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Baker">Colin Baker</a>. Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Finish_Productions">Big Finish</a>'s range of original Doctor Who audio adventures. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord">Time Lord</a> alien from the planet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey">Gallifrey</a> who travels in time and space in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation, a flamboyant man in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations.<br />
        The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons. His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caves_of_Androzani"><em>The Caves of Androzani</em></a> which featured the regeneration from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor">Fifth Doctor</a> and thereafter in the following serial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twin_Dilemma"><em>The Twin Dilemma</em></a>, the end of that season. The Sixth Doctor's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Grade">Michael Grade</a> to put the series on an 18-month &quot;hiatus&quot; between seasons 22 and 23, with only one new <em>Doctor Who</em> story, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipback"><em>Slipback</em></a>, made on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio">radio</a> during the hiatus, broadcast as 6 parts (at 10 minutes each) on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4">BBC Radio 4</a> from 25 July to 8 August 1985, as part of a children's magazine show called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Radio_Four"><em>Pirate Radio Four</em></a>. Colin Baker had been signed up for four years,[1] as the previous actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Davison">Peter Davison</a> had left after only three years.<br />
      Prior to its postponement, season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production. Alongside &quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot;, The Ultimate Evil&quot;, &quot;Mission to Magnus&quot;, &quot;Yellow Fever and How to Cure It&quot;, the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed. These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord"><em>The Trial of a Time Lord</em></a>.[2] The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time"><em>Dimensions in Time</em></a>. There are also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_spin-offs">novels and audio plays</a> featuring the Sixth Doctor, and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s production of the show.</p>
